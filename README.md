# Java 6 Cinema

This repository hosts a student Java project, by the group n°6 in the advanced programming class. 

# Application 

This app uses several Google Maps APIs and HTML Parsing of google movies service to help a bored user. 
From the user's location the app can give him a list of movies being shown in the nearby cinemas.

# Testing 

The app is still in development phase but you can already test some of the features by using the classes in the "tests" package : 
- TestClosestCinemas gets the closest cinemas in a 10km radius
- TestHTMLParser tests the Google movies html parsing
- TestTimeToCinema tests the program that calculates the time it takes to go from a place to a cinema
- TestCinemaFinder is a more global program that tests the program's ability to suggest a close cinema
- TestGUI was meant to test the graphical interface but has actually become the main method.
